# Rubik's Cube Solver - Using Korf's IDA\* Algorithm

## Overview
This project implements a Rubik's Cube (3x3) solver using Korf's IDA\* algorithm. The solver is designed in C++ and includes three different models/classes utilizing standard data structures.

## Features
- **Multiple Algorithms**: The solver incorporates Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS), and Korf's Iterative Deepening A\* (IDA\*) algorithms.
- **Efficient Solving**: 
  - Achieves solving time of under 3 seconds for a Rubik's Cube jumbled 8 times using BFS, DFS, and IDDFS.
  - Achieves solving time of under 10 seconds for a Rubik's Cube jumbled 13 times using Korf's IDA\* algorithm.

## Implementation Details
- **Languages and Tools**: The project is implemented in C++.
- **Data Structures**: Utilizes standard data structures available in C++.

## Usage
- The solver can be used to solve a randomly jumbled Rubik's Cube.
- Various algorithms can be selected to observe their performance on different jumbled states of the cube.
